## Script Breakdown

### SCENE 1: Hook (0-30 seconds)

**Visual:** Show landing page of The Climb

**Voiceover:**
> "You played 200 ranked games this year. So did the people you matched with back in January. 
> 
> Some of them climbed to Platinum. Some fell to Silver. What separated them?
>
> Most coaching tools compare you to Challenger players. But you're Gold. The gap is too big. 
>
> You need to see what players at YOUR level did to climb just one rank higher."

**Action:** Slow pan over the landing page, show the tagline "Who Passed You Up?"

---

### SCENE 2: The Problem (30-60 seconds)

**Visual:** Cut to quick comparison of op.gg vs The Climb

**Voiceover:**
> "Sites like op.gg show you stats. Build orders. Champion win rates. 
>
> But they don't answer the real question: Why are players who started at your rank now ahead of you?
>
> That's where The Climb comes in."

**Action:** 
- Quick clip of op.gg showing generic stats
- Transition to The Climb interface

---

### SCENE 3: The Demo (60-150 seconds)

**Visual:** Live demo of the analysis

**Voiceover:**
> "Enter your summoner name and region..."

**Action:** Type in summoner name, click "Analyze My Climb"

**Voiceover:**
> "The Climb uses the Riot Games API to analyze every player you matched with in early 2025.
>
> It categorizes them: who climbed higher, who fell behind, who stayed similar.
>
> Then it uses AWS Bedrock with Claude 3.5 Sonnet to analyze the behavioral differences."

**Action:** Show loading screen, then results appearing

**Visual:** Highlight key sections as you narrate:

**Voiceover:**
> "Here's what makes this different. Look at this player—you matched against them in January when you were both Gold 3. 
>
> Now they're Platinum 2. You're Gold 2.
>
> So what changed?"

**Action:** Show the AI insights appearing

**Voiceover:**
> "The AI doesn't just say 'play better.' It identifies specific behavioral patterns.
>
> [Read one insight from screen, e.g.:]
> 'Climbers stop playing after 2-3 losses. You average 5-game loss streaks. The gap isn't mechanics—it's tilt control.'
>
> That's actionable. That's something you can fix TODAY."

**Action:** Scroll through action plan

**Voiceover:**
> "And it gives you a specific action plan based on YOUR data."

---

### SCENE 4: Technical Overview (150-165 seconds)

**Visual:** Quick architecture diagram or code snippets (optional)

**Voiceover:**
> "Technically, this isn't trivial. 
>
> We pull your full match history using Riot's API, extract every player you encountered, track their current ranks, and filter for valid comparisons.
>
> Then AWS Bedrock analyzes behavioral patterns across all groups—climbers, stuck players, and you.
>
> The AI identifies what matters most and generates personalized insights.
>
> This is essential AI—without the reasoning layer, you just get raw stat comparisons."

---

### SCENE 5: Impact & Closing (165-180 seconds)

**Visual:** Return to polished UI, show action plan

**Voiceover:**
> "Instead of generic advice, you get: 'Climbers at your level stop after 2 losses. You average 5-game loss streaks. That's your gap.'
>
> Specific. Personal. Actionable.
>
> Based on real players at your skill level who succeeded.
>
> Because you're not Faker. And that's okay.
>
> You just need to know what the next step looks like—and how players like you took it.
>
> That's The Climb."

**Action:** Fade to project title card with:
- "The Climb - Who Passed You Up?"
- "Powered by AWS Bedrock & Riot Games API"
- "Rift Rewind Hackathon 2025"

## Recording Tips

1. **Practice first** - Do a full run-through without recording
2. **Clear audio** - Close windows, turn off fans, speak clearly
3. **Steady screen** - No shaky mouse movements
4. **Use real data** - Show actual analysis results, not fake data
5. **Keep it moving** - 3 minutes goes fast, don't linger
6. **Show don't tell** - Let the UI speak for itself where possible

## Alternative: Quick Cut Version

If short on time, use this simpler structure:

**0-20s:** Problem statement + hook  
**20-120s:** Full demo showing analysis  
**120-150s:** Show AI insights (the magic)  
**150-180s:** Quick tech overview + closing

## What to Emphasize

✅ **Personal** - Uses YOUR games, YOUR opponents  
✅ **Novel** - No one else does peer trajectory comparison  
✅ **GenAI is essential** - Not cosmetic, it's the insight engine  
✅ **Actionable** - Specific behavioral changes, not generic advice  
✅ **Beyond op.gg** - Comparing to similar players who climbed
